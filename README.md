# Weather App

## Overview
This Weather App provides a simple, user-friendly interface to display current and upcoming weather conditions. The app uses data from a weather API ("https://openweathermap.org/") to provide accurate information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other key metrics. It's designed to be responsive and adjusts to various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.

## Features
- Displays the current weather for a given location.
- Shows daily weather forecasts.
- Provides detailed information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- Includes weather-related icons to represent conditions such as rain, snow, and fog.
- Customizable layout with background images that change according to the weather conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS/SCSS**: Styling with flexbox and grid layout for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic data fetching from the weather API and DOM manipulation.
- **Weather API**: For retrieving weather data.
- **Serverless Functions**: For hiding sensitive information, the API key, by making requests to the Weather API through a secure serverless function.
